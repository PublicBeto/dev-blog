title: "Unreal Engine PSX look"

I've been investigating a while to get a good PSX (or PS2) look. The idea is to maintain a normal pipelline but a different engines setup so making a game should be the same.


## Screen Percentage

No use a post process filter to pixelate, it will have alias and you will loose detail. Use instead screen percentage:

40% seems to be the sweet spot.

 In Editor:
	1. Go to `DefaultEngine.ini`
	2. Add this line under `[SystemSettings]`:
		`r.ScreenPercentage=40`

In Package:
	1. Go to `DefaultGame.ini`
	2. Add this line under `[SystemSettings]`:
		`r.ScreenPercentage=40`
			

## Anti-Alias Disable

To disable anti-alias:

In Editor:
-   Open your project in Unreal Engine 5.
-   Go to **Edit > Project Settings**.
-   Under **Engine > Rendering**, find **Anti-Aliasing Method**.
-   Set it to **None**.

In Package:
1.  Navigate to your project's config folder:  
    `YourProject/Config/DefaultEngine.ini`
2.  Add or modify the following under `[SystemSettings]`:

`[SystemSettings]`
`r.DefaultFeature.AntiAliasing=0  r.PostProcessAAQuality=0`

## Textures

To quickly setup all the textures in the project, select all the textures via `Asset Action -> Edit Selection in Property Matrix`. Inside the bulk edition window pin and change the following:

 - `Texture -> Filter -> Nearest`
 - `Compression -> Maximum Texture Size -> 512`
 - `Compressiono -> Compression Settings -> BC7` Only for the default textures (no Normals)
